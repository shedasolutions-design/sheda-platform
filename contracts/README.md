# Sheda Contracts

The NEAR contracts behind Sheda. A marketplace that holds listings, bids and
escrow, and the Collections contracts that sit on top of it: a vault that owns
one unit on behalf of many people and splits its rent among them, a raise that
escrows commitments and releases them a phase at a time, and the stake registry
that backs a builder's promises.

The vault is the piece the whole design rests on: it is an account, so the
marketplace needs no knowledge that a flat has three hundred landlords. It
treats the vault exactly like any other owner.

---

## The idea in one paragraph

The Sheda rental marketplace knows one thing about ownership: a property NFT
has an owner account, and that owner lists it, accepts bids and gets paid. It
never asks whether that account belongs to a person. This contract is an
account. It holds the NFT, so it is the landlord, and **the marketplace needs
no change at all** to let a flat owned by three hundred people be rented
exactly like a flat owned by one.

What the vault adds is the split. Shares are a fungible token; rent arriving
is divided among whoever holds them, in proportion, in arrears.

## Why shares are fungible and not smaller NFTs

Ten people splitting a flat do not own ten distinguishable things. They own
ten identical claims, and the point is that those claims divide again, add
together, and sell in part. That is a fungible token.

Numbered sub-NFTs would mean writing division, merging and partial transfer by
hand, every one of them a place to get arithmetic wrong with other people's
money. So the unit stays an NFT, because a flat is a specific flat, and the
claims on it are fungible, because a tenth of the rent is a tenth of the rent.

## Nobody is paid when rent arrives

The obvious implementation loops over holders and pays each one. It stops
working past a few dozen of them, because a transaction has a gas ceiling and
the loop eventually does not fit inside it. It would pass every test and fail
once the product succeeded.

So one number moves instead:

```
on income:   acc_per_share += income × 1e18 ÷ total_shares
a holder:    owed = balance × acc_per_share ÷ 1e18 − already_credited
on claim:    pay owed, then already_credited = balance × acc_per_share ÷ 1e18
```

Crediting income costs the same for ten holders and ten thousand, because
nothing iterates over them. Holders pull with `claim()`.

**The rule that makes it honest:** a balance may not move until both sides are
settled against the accumulator. `internal_transfer` settles the sender and
the receiver, moves the shares, then re-baselines both. Without it, someone
buying shares on Monday would collect rent that accrued in March.

The division remainder is carried in `dust` and joins the next credit, so
repeated small payments lose nothing.

## Rent arrives silently

The deployed marketplace pays landlords with plain `ft_transfer`. This was
checked rather than assumed. Reading the bytecode of
`market.shedauser.testnet` (the first marketplace; `market-v2` runs the same payout code) over RPC shows the literals:

```
accept_bid … "ft_transfer successful, proceeding with NFT transfer and bid updates"
cross-contract args … ft_transfer · receiver_id · amount · memo
```

There is no standalone `ft_transfer_call` anywhere in it, and NEP-141
`ft_transfer` notifies nobody. So money lands in the vault without the vault
being told, and `sync_income()` goes and looks: it reads the token balance,
compares it to what was last accounted for, and credits the difference.

It is open to anyone to call. If it needed the manager, a manager who stopped
calling it would freeze every holder out of their own rent.

Two details that matter:

- The balance read is compared against a **snapshot taken when the sync
  started**, not against `last_accounted` at callback time. A claim settling
  in between moves that figure, and using it would credit money that had
  already left.
- A share purchase must never arrive at this same balance, or it would be
  distributed as rent. The raise escrow is a separate account for exactly
  this reason.

## What is in here

A cargo workspace. Each contract deploys on its own account.

| Crate | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `contracts/market` | Property NFTs, listings, bids, purchase and lease escrow, deposits, disputes |
| `contracts/raise` | Escrow commitments, the phase schedule, refunds and opt-outs |
| `contracts/vault` | One unit, its shares, and its rent |
| `contracts/stake-registry` | Builder and manager stake, per profile |

Inside the vault:

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | State, initialisation, governance, views |
| `shares.rs` | The share ledger and NEP-141 core, with settle-on-transfer |
| `income.rs` | Accumulator, `sync_income`, `claim`, fees, reserve |
| `custody.rs` | Taking the unit in, and redemption |
| `market.rs` | Manager instructions forwarded to the marketplace |
| `ext.rs` | The contracts this one talks to |
| `tests.rs` | The arithmetic that decides who gets paid what |

## The stake registry

Stake belongs to a profile, not to a deal, so a builder who abandons one
project finds it harder to raise for the next.

The accounting is the point. A builder with ₦10m staked who opens three
raises, each advertising 18% cover, has promised the same ₦10m three times,
and every investor sees a figure that is only true if the other two succeed.
So a balance is **total**, **allocated** and **free**, and a raise cannot
advertise cover the free balance does not support.

Each allocation is ring-fenced to its own project. A slash reaches only that
project's share, because otherwise one failure drains the cover out from
under investors in a different project who did nothing wrong.

Cover is reported from the contract as basis points of a target rather than
computed in the app, so the figure on a project card is the figure the chain
would actually pay.

### Methods

**Anyone**

- `sync_income()`: credit whatever has arrived
- `ft_balance_of`, `ft_total_supply`, `ft_metadata`, `ownership_bps`
- `claimable(account_id)`: settled plus accrued, right now
- `get_info()`, `get_reserve()`, `withdraw_treasury_fee()`

**Holders** (1 yocto)

- `ft_transfer(receiver_id, amount, memo)`
- `claim()`
- `redeem()`: only with every share, and only when the flat is not let

**Manager** (1 yocto)

- `list_for_rent(price, lease_duration_days)`, `delist()`
- `accept_bid(bid_id)`, `reject_bid(bid_id)`
- `release_documents(bid_id, uri, description)`: forwards to the marketplace's `confirm_document_release`
- `draw_reserve(amount, to, reason)`
- `withdraw_manager_fee()`

**Governance** (1 yocto)

- `mint_shares(to, amount)`, `freeze_supply()`
- `set_manager(manager)`, `set_fees(manager_bps, reserve_bps, platform_bps)`

## Rules the contract enforces

- Fees together may never exceed **30%** of rent. A vault where configuration
  could leave holders with nothing is one where it eventually will.
- Supply freezes permanently at the close of the raise. No mint path survives
  it, for anyone. Dilution after people have bought is indistinguishable
  from theft.
- A unit is only accepted from its own marketplace, and only if its token id
  matches the property this vault was created for.
- Redemption takes **every** share, and is refused while the flat is let. A
  redemption mid-tenancy would hand the NFT to someone who was not party to
  the lease and leave the tenant's deposit against a vault owning nothing.
- A failed payout restores what it was paying. The one outcome worse than a
  payout not happening is a holder's entitlement being erased while the money
  stays in the vault.
- Replacing a manager does not cancel fees they have already earned.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test --workspace --lib
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build --workspace --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

CI runs all three on every push. The unit tests cover the risk-register rows
that can be proven without a network: pro-rata distribution, settlement on
transfer in both directions, rounding conservation across a hundred
payments, the fee split reconstructing the whole, the fee ceiling, the supply
freeze, and a thousand-holder reconciliation.

What they do not cover is anything crossing contracts: `sync_income`,
`claim`, `redeem` and the marketplace forwarders all need a sandbox. Those
tests come with stage 2's integration gate, against a real deployed
marketplace.

## Deployed

Testnet, built by CI and deployed from that wasm. Nothing is on mainnet and
nothing should be: none of this has been audited.

| Contract | Account | Code hash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Marketplace (owner: the council) | `market-v2.shedauser.testnet` | `2hao5nFt23txShVDyrJpU2Fqi6tQopknBcnmPoMKj8C1` (reproducible build from CI) |
| Raise (testnet build) | `sheda-raise-v4.testnet` | `Cj1vm2XeK6dZVfmjYxoGwVprcrudnH47fFraGbhCaVW5` |
| Stake registry | `sheda-stake-v4.testnet` | `4Nk36ainzRDjHhXbPmYPsr1i74Eon73ttadtP5x4GjuH` |
| Flat vaults | `sheda-v4-pgt-t2`, `sheda-v4-pgt-t3`, `sheda-v4-lgf-f1`, `sheda-v4-lgf-f2` (`.testnet`) | `AzpUJujH5RS9X5qmhPBT3ES3KMgoLe2V3JVJ3K7zV3X2` |
| Council (2-of-3 multisig; owner of the marketplace, raise and stake; treasury) | `sheda-council.testnet` | `HRP7Qf2HDaXTD8EWs7G8siNNGxWWBCe1JaDxcM2cJmQR` |

v4 was deployed on 2026-11-12 from this source with the pinned Rust 1.86 (the same code as v3, which pointed at the old marketplace `market.shedauser.testnet`; that key was lost, so the marketplace was redeployed as `market-v2.shedauser.testnet` and Collections moved with it). The
raise is built with `--features testnet` (objection window of 3 minutes, not 7
days) so the whole flow can be tested in one sitting; a mainnet build must not
enable that feature. Every owner action (opening a raise, linking a vault,
declaring a stall) goes through `sheda-council.testnet`, NEAR's standard
multisig (core-contracts `multisig2`) with members `sheda-signer-a/b/c.testnet`
and 2 confirmations required. Raises pay in `usdc.fakes.testnet`. A frozen
phase stops the raise; every investor can then `reclaim` their share of the
unpaid escrow and `opt_out` for their share of the builder's cover,
independently. Vaults divide rent over every share of the flat (`share_cap`),
so late claimers lose nothing and nobody can redeem a flat without holding all
of it. v1 and v2 raised nothing real and are no longer used.

The registry's controller is the raise contract. That is the whole of the
authority to touch a builder's stake: a stalled project can slash the cover
allocated to it, and nothing else can reach it at all.

Both accounts are their own owner on testnet, which is fine for a throwaway
and is not how this should be set up anywhere real. Versioned names rather
than plain ones, so a change that breaks the stored state goes to v2 instead
of needing a migration written for data nobody minds losing.

The wasm comes out of CI because this is the only machine in the loop with a
toolchain that can link one. `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
still needs a host linker for the proc-macro crates, so a laptop without
build tools cannot produce these binaries however the target is set.

## What the Sheda app binds to

Collections now ships inside the main Sheda app, which reads these
contracts directly over RPC and signs against them with the user's own
wallet. That makes the following a published interface rather than an
internal one: renaming any of it breaks a deployed app, and the two live in
separate repositories so the compiler will not say so.

The app calls exactly these, and nothing else.

**Vault**, per unit, at an account id the app is told at runtime.

| Method | Shape the app expects |
| --- | --- |
| `get_info()` | `VaultInfo`. Every `U128` and the `U64` property id arrive as JSON strings and are parsed as BigInt. |
| `ft_balance_of(account_id)` | `U128` |
| `claimable(account_id)` | `U128`, settled plus accrued |
| `claim()` | 1 yocto |
| `sync_income()` | no deposit, callable by anyone |
| `ft_transfer(receiver_id, amount, memo)` | 1 yocto |

**Stake registry**, one account for the platform.

| Method | Shape the app expects |
| --- | --- |
| `get_profile(account_id)` | `ProfileView` with `total`, `allocated`, `free`, `slashed_total`, `slash_count` |
| `cover_bps(project_id, account_id, target)` | `u32` basis points |
| `withdraw(amount)` | 1 yocto |
| `ft_on_transfer(...)` | reached by `ft_transfer_call` on the stablecoin, `msg` empty to credit the sender |

**Raise**, one account for escrow and the phase schedule.

| Method | Shape the app expects |
| --- | --- |
| `get_project(project_id)` | `builder`, `manager`, `stablecoin`, `target`, `raised`, `released`, `status`, `phases`, `units` |
| `get_commitment(project_id, account_id, unit)` | `U128` |
| `shares_owed(project_id, unit, account_id)` | `U128`; zero after a claim |
| `claim_shares(project_id, unit)` | 1 yocto; mints against the vault the raise recorded |
| `request_inspection(project_id, phase)` | 1 yocto; builder |
| `attest(project_id, phase)` | 1 yocto; manager, never the builder |
| `object(project_id, phase)` | 1 yocto; holder inside the window |
| `close_raise(project_id)` | no deposit; anyone once full or expired |
| `set_unit_vault(project_id, unit_code, vault)` | owner, 1 yocto, once per flat |

The live `sheda-raise-v4.testnet` has `shares_owed` and `set_unit_vault`,
and each demo flat has its vault set, so the claim flow works end to end.

Two things about that table are load bearing.

**Amounts stay strings the whole way.** A JSON number is a double and exact
only to 2^53. A unit price sits below that, but `acc_per_share` is scaled by
1e18 and passes 1e25 in ordinary use, and a holder's owed figure is
`balance * acc_per_share` before it is divided back down. The app never
parses an amount into a number.

**The app reproduces `claimable` locally for display and never for a
payout.** It can show an accrued figure between syncs, but income credited
since the last read exists only here, so anything about to move money reads
this view first.

Deployment ids go in the app's `config/collections.ts`. An empty id there
means that part of Collections is not live, which the screens say plainly
rather than treating as an error, so the two contracts can ship separately.

## Not here yet

Governance and voting, and the share market. Shares move by `ft_transfer` for
now; a share market will need `ft_transfer_call` and will bring its resolve
path with it rather than having it sit here unused.

Per-unit vault deployment is also not built here: the raise records where a
vault lives and mints against it, but nothing creates the account yet.
