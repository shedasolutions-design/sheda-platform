//! The contracts this one talks to.
//!
//! Every signature here was written against the other contract's source
//! rather than from memory. Two bindings in the vault were wrong in exactly
//! this way once: one method had gained an argument and another had been
//! renamed, and both compiled perfectly and would have failed at runtime,
//! because a cross-contract call is a string and a JSON blob that nothing
//! type checks until it arrives.
