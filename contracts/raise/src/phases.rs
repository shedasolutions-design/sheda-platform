//! Releasing the money, one phase at a time.
//!
//! Three parties, in sequence, and no single one of them can move money:
//!
//!   the builder says a phase is finished
//!   the manager inspects it and attests, and cannot be the builder
//!   holders get seven days to object, and enough objections hold the money
//!
//! The last step is the one that is easy to leave out and the one that
//! matters most. Without it an investor's only recourse against a bad
//! inspection is to have chosen a different manager months earlier.
