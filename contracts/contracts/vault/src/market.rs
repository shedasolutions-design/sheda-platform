//! Letting the unit, through the marketplace that already exists.
//!
//! This is the whole of the integration, and it is deliberately thin. The
//! marketplace lets an owner list, accept a bid and release documents. The
//! vault is the owner. So the manager calls the vault and the vault makes the
//! same call under its own name. No marketplace code changes, and a property
//! held by three hundred people behaves exactly like one held by a landlord.
//!
//! The manager never holds the NFT and cannot move it. Everything here is a
//! forwarded instruction, not custody.
